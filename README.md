### License
Whatever the fuck you want. Do you know how **long** it took me to figure out how to put this together? _And make it up to date?_ A long-ass time. An overwhelming majority of the Internet is totally fine with a bajillion dependencies that do...who cares, I'm not adding all that shit to my projects. KISS my ass.

Together, you and I will make the Web a better place. Let's call this a silent movement, "show and prove," if you will. Beautiful apps are more than the interface. The plumbing should be nice, right? Lipstick on a pig is still paint on a ham sandwich. Respect yourself.

### TODO
- Add more meat to this. This is intended as a starting point for my own future apps.
- Add Sass files and package script.
